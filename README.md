# Exploratory Data Analysis Project On BRFSS Survey Data Using R

This project was completed as the final project for the course Intro to Probability and Data which is part of Coursera's Statistics With R specialisation.

The goal of this project was to answer three interesting research questions involving the variables present in the BRFSS survey data (a codebook for which can be found in this repository). After generating the research questions, an EDA stage was carried out on the data, followed by a summary section highlighting the important associations that may be present between the variables. 

Please see the attached HTML file for a walk through of the project.

Thank you for your time and interest!
